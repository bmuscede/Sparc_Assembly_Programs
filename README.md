Sparc_Assembly_Programs
=======================

Collection of programs written in SPARC assembly language. These demonstrate a proficiency in assembly language.<br>
<br>
Overview of Programs:<br>
arrayadd.m - Allows you input elements into an array and then the program outputs the total.<br>
checksum.m - Determines if an internet checksum is valid. Asks for a checksum and then outputs either a 'V' for valid or 'I' for invalid.<br>
conv.m - Converts any base-10 number into any base (so long as its between 1 and 36).<br>
conv4.m - Converts a base-10 number to base 4.<br>
iofunc.o - Needed for building any of these .m files. Provides certain io functions (reading characters, etc). Not created by me.<br>
multiplication.m - Simple multiplication program. Simulates hardware multiplication on the SPARC processor.<br>
simplevar.m - Program that demostrates the use of a variable in assembly.<br>
varpractice.m - Program that demonstrates variables in assembly.<br>
